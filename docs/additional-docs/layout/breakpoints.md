# Breakpoints

The breakpoints are based on the Bootstrap 5 grid, see docs [here](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/)

## Available breakpoints

Bootstrap includes six default breakpoints, sometimes referred to as _grid tiers_, for building responsively.

<table style='max-width: 500px'>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Breakpoint</th>
      <th>Class infix</th>
      <th>Dimensions</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>X-Small</td>
      <td><em>None</em></td>
      <td>&lt;576px</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Small</td>
      <td>sm</td>
      <td>&ge;576px</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Medium</td>
      <td>md</td>
      <td>&ge;768px</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Large</td>
      <td>lg</td>
      <td>&ge;992px</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Extra large</td>
      <td>xl</td>
      <td>&ge;1200px</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Extra extra large</td>
      <td>xxl</td>
      <td>&ge;1400px</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Each breakpoint was chosen to comfortably hold containers whose widths are multiples of 24.
Breakpoints are also representative of a subset of common device sizes and viewport dimensionsâ€”they don't specifically target every use case or device.
Instead, the ranges provide a strong and consistent foundation to build on for nearly any device.
